This is the README file for Class::Generate, version 1.00.

Class::Generate is a Perl5 module to simplify creating class
hierarchies.  It offers typed or untyped scalar, array, and hash
members, required members, private members, methods (both
instance and class), and other common features of object-
oriented software development.  Of course, you can implement all
these things without a special module, but doing it via
Class::Generate is much, much more concise.  And futhermore,
it's much less error prone: if you are using Perl's -w flag,
Class::Generate will catch many class specification and usage
errors.

The distribution consists of the following files:

  --	README (this file)
  --	Generate.pm
  --	Generate.pod
  --	example.pl

Generate.pm is the file containing the Class::Generate module.
You will need to install it on your site in directory
<perllib>/Class/Generate.pm.  You can then reference it from your
Perl scripts as follows:

    use Class::Generate;

assuming <perllib> is in your Perl include path.

Generate.pod contains the documentation, in POD format.  It is
sufficiently large that I decided to place it in a separate file.

example.pl contains some code illustrating how to use the class()
and subclass() functions.
